# World-Cybersecurity-Threats-Data-Analysis
This is a data analysis and visualization ptoject create using MS Excel and Power BI.
Dataset Source: Kaggle

Detailed Study and Analysis
This dataset focuses on cybersecurity incidents. Here's what each column represents:
1.	Country: The geographic location where the cyber attack occurred or where its impact was reported.
2.	Year: The year in which the attack took place, useful for identifying trends over time.
3.	Attack Type: The category of cyber attack (e.g., DDoS, phishing, ransomware, etc.).
4.	Target Industry: The sector affected by the attack (e.g., finance, healthcare, government, etc.).
5.	Financial Loss (in Million $): The monetary impact of the attack, potentially including ransom payments, business disruption, or data recovery costs.
6.	Number of Affected Users: The total number of individuals whose data, accounts, or systems were compromised.
7.	Attack Source: The origin or method of the attack (e.g., insider threat, nation-state actors, hacking groups).
8.	Security Vulnerability Type: The exploited weakness (e.g., zero-day vulnerability, SQL injection, unpatched software).
9.	Defense Mechanism Used: The protective measures employed to counter the attack (e.g., firewalls, encryption, security patches).
10.	Incident Resolution Time (in Hours): The total time taken to mitigate, recover from, or fully resolve the cyber attack.
This dataset could be valuable for analyzing attack patterns, understanding industry-specific risks, or evaluating the effectiveness of security measures.

Insights
Your dataset offers rich potential for insights and visualizations. Here are some meaningful ideas categorized by analysis type:
________________________________________
1. Trend Analysis
•	Number of Attacks Over Time: Visualize attack frequency across years using a line chart to identify trends.
•	Financial Loss Trend: Track rising/falling financial losses with a time series plot.
•	Resolution Time Trend: Identify whether incident resolution times are improving or worsening over time.
Visuals: Line charts, area charts, heatmaps for temporal patterns.

2. Geographic Analysis
•	Attack Distribution by Country: Use a choropleth map to visualize regions most affected by cyberattacks.
•	Country-wise Financial Loss: Highlight top countries facing the highest monetary losses.
Visuals: Geo-maps, bar charts with country rankings.
________________________________________
3. Attack Type Insights
•	Most Common Attack Types: Display the frequency of different attack types using a bar chart or pie chart.
•	Attack Type vs. Financial Loss: Use a boxplot or violin plot to analyze which attack types cause the most damage.
Visuals: Bar charts, pie charts, boxplots.
________________________________________
4. Industry Impact Analysis
•	Targeted Industries Analysis: Identify which sectors are most vulnerable.
•	Industry-wise Financial Loss: Pinpoint industries with the highest recovery costs.
Visuals: Horizontal bar charts, grouped bar charts.
________________________________________
5. Correlation Analysis
•	Financial Loss vs. Number of Affected Users: Identify patterns in monetary loss based on the number of users impacted.
•	Incident Resolution Time vs. Attack Type: Determine if some attack types take longer to resolve than others.
Visuals: Scatter plots, correlation heatmaps.

6. Security Insights
•	Most Exploited Vulnerabilities: Identify the most frequently exploited weaknesses.
•	Effectiveness of Defense Mechanisms: Compare resolution times for different security strategies.
Visuals: Stacked bar charts, radar charts.
________________________________________
7. Severity Analysis
•	High-impact Attacks: Filter and analyze incidents with extreme financial loss or user impact.
•	Resolution Time Outliers: Highlight unusually long incident recovery periods.
Visuals: Boxplots, scatter plots.

8. Predictive Analysis (Advanced)
•	Predict Future Trends: Use regression models to predict attack frequency, financial loss trends, or resolution time.
•	Risk Scoring Models: Develop a scoring system to assess potential risk by combining factors like attack type, vulnerability, and industry.
Visuals: Line charts, decision trees, regression plots.
